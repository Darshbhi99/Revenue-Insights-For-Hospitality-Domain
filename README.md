## Tables of Data Analysis:

1. Fact Bookings Table (Customer wise Distribution):-
    - booking_id: This column represents the Unique Booking ID for each customer when they booked their rooms.
    - property_id: This column represents the Unique ID for each of the hotels
    - booking_date: This column represents the date on which the customer booked their rooms.
    - check_in_date: This column represents the date on which the customer check-in(entered) at the hotel.
    - check_out_date: This column represents the date on which the customer check-out(left) of the hotel.
    - no_guests: This column represents the number of guests who stayed in a particular room in that hotel.
    - room_category: This column represents the type of room[RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4] in a hotel.

    - revenue_generated: This column represents the amount of money generated by the hotel from a particular customer.
    - revenue_realized: This column represents the final amount of money that goes to the hotel based on booking status. 
      If the booking status is cancelled, then 40% of the revenue generated is deducted and the remaining is refunded to the customer. 
      If the booking status is Checked Out/No show, then full revenue generated will goes to hotels.

2. Fact Aggregate Bookings Table (Property wise Distribution) :-

    - room_category: This column represents the type of room[RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4] in a hotel.
    - successful_bookings: This column represents all the successful room bookings that happen for a particular room type 
      in that hotel on that particular date.
    - capacity: This column represents the maximum count of rooms available for a particular room type in that hotel on 
      that particular date.

3. Dim Date table :-
    - date: This column represents the dates present in May, June and July.
    - mmm yy: This column represents the date in the format of mmm yy (monthname year).
    - week no: This column represents the unique week number for that particular date.
    - day_type: This column represents whether the given day is Weekend or Weekeday.

4. Dim Hotels table (Hotel Info Table):-
    - property_id: This column represents the Unique ID for each of the hotels.
    - property_name: This column represents the name of each hotel.
    - category: This column determines which class[Luxury, Business] a particular hotel/property belongs to. 
    - city: This column represents where the particular hotel/property resides in.

5. Dim Rooms table:-
   - room_id: This column represents the type of room[RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4] in a hotel.
   - room_class: This column represents to which class[Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential] 
     particular room type belongs.

## Roadmap

1. Loading the Data from CSV files into PowerBI Desktop.

2. Performing Data Cleaning such as Removing the NULL values and unwanted data. 

3. Adding the columns such as Week Number for every week and day_type as "Weekday" or "Weekend"
   as for Hotel Chain Weekends as Friday and Saturday

4. Creating Measures for Total Revenue Generated, Total Bookings, Total Capacity,
   Total Successful Bookings, Percentage measures for all Columns, ADR(Average Daily Rate), 
   RevPAR(Revenue Per Available Room), DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights), DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights), 
   DURN(Daily Utilized Room Nights), Measures to Calculate Week on Week Changes for each 
   parameter. 

## DAX Functions Used

SUM(), COUNT(), AVERAGE(), DIVIDE(), DATEDIFF(), CALCULATE(), ALL(), HASONEFILTER(), 
SELECTEDVALUE(), FILTER() 

## Measures Used for Analysis 

1. ADR (Average Daily Rates)
   - It is ratio for total revenue by total bookings 
   - Average revenue for each booking done

2. RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
   - It is ratio for total revenue by Total capacity
   - Average revenue for each available room

3. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Night)
   - It is ratio for total no. of bookings by total no. of days

4. DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Night)
   - It is ratio for total no. of rooms by total no. of days

5. DURN (Daily Usable Room Night)
   - It is ratio for total no. checked out by total no. of days

6. ALOS (Average Length of Stay)
   - It is ratio for total no. days stayed by Total Bookings

## Lessons Learned

### Conclusion
Web Scrapping and Analysing data. Data transformation in power query.
PowerBI Chart creation. Adding Measures using DAX Functions.

## Analysis 
1. There are different levers to improve revenue in hotel industry one of the lever is pricing
   such as the room prices for weekday is less as the demand is less but same rooms prices go 
   up in the weekends due to more demand.

2. As the May, June and July these 3 months are summer vacations in India still data suggests 
   that the overall revenue by weeks i.e RevPAR percentage has been stable as throughout even 
   without applying any kind of sales strategies for weekdays and weekends. They are selling 
   the rooms at static prices as per the room categories as ADR is constant throughout. 

3. There are 3 types of pricing strategies use by the Hotel Management. Flat Pricings, 
   Weekday/Weekend Pricings and Dynamic Pricings.

4. To check strategy for pricing for these hotels we can see the table for weekday and weekends
   metrics. We can see the weekends have higher occupancy than Weekdays still the ADR is almost
   same for both sections. This proves that this hotel chain is using Flat price strategies. 
   There is a big opportunity for application of dynamic or weekend pricing strategy for revenue 
   increase.

5. How does the pricing influence the occupancy ?
   When you see a drop in rates i.e ADR we see an increase in occupancy whereas if we increase 
   the rates  we see an decrese in occupancy. This strategy is somewhat affected by the region 
   and the market elasticity in that region.

6. In Hotel chain Management there is a principle called "Pareto Principle" i.e 80-20 Rule i.e
   80% revenue drop is because of 20% worst performing hotels or 80% revenue is generated by 20%
   of the best performing hotels. If we fix the problem statement for worst performing hotels the
   revenue increases automatically.

7. So if we see the hotels with lowest occupancy have the lowest ratings as well and the 
   cancellation was also slightly higher than the other hotels. This tells us the particular 
   hotels that needs to be checked i.e kind of service, kind of rooms and other criterias.

8. In Realisation % and ADR by Platform Graph  we can see the that the average prices for offline
   are highest and that for online platforms is lesser as offline purchase there is no commission 
   included hence there are chances of revenue increase if we drop the prices in offline mode or 
   use a dynamic pricing but in a different way as providing coupons and free goodies.

9. Pricing can be one of the strategies to increase the revenue whereas we can increase that night 
   stay and many more.
